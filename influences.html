        <p>Among other factors, critics and historians have written that Woodman was influenced by the following literary genre, myth, artistic movement, and photographers:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <li>Gothic fiction. She is reported to have identified with Victorian heroines. Many of the stories feature a female figure that is often forced into solitude, then they turn mad. The Gothic style is full of symbols of tombs, mirrors, demons and angels.</li>
                   <li>Surrealism. She studied surrealism immensely and studied the workings of Duane Michals. For example, Woodman "followed the movement's tradition of not explaining work" and demonstrated a "desire to crack the code of appearances.</li>
                   <li>André Breton and in particular his Nadja of 1928. In a 1979 interview with Roberta Valtorta, Woodman is reported as saying "Vorrei che le parole avessero con le mie immagini lo stesso rapporto che le fotografie hanno con il testo in Nadja di André Breton" ("I would like words to have the same relationship with my images as the photographs have with the text in Nadja by André Breton". Translated by Dunhill.)</li>
                   <li>Man Ray (e.g., a series of his photographs of Meret Oppenheim, and his surrealist works).</li>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <li>Duane Michals. Woodman's and Michals's work share features such as blurring, angels, and handwriting in common.</li>
                    <li>Deborah Turbeville.Woodman had "admired" Turbeville's work, and had compiled an artist's book for Turbeville (Quaderno Raffaello) which contained a written request for the older photographer to telephone her.</li>
                    <li>Woodman was exposed to the symbolic work of Max Klinger whilst studying in Rome from 1977 to 1978 and his influence can clearly be seen in many photographic series’, such as Eel Series, Roma (1977–78) and Angel Series, Roma (1977). In combining performance, play and self-exposure, Woodman’s photographs create extreme and often disturbing psychological states. In concealing or encrypting her subjects she reminds the viewer that photographs flatten and distort, never offering the whole truth about a subject.</li>
                    <li>Woodman worked closely with her friend George Lange, another alumni from Rhode Island School of Design. During a major exhibition held in honor of Woodman at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver Director Nora Burnett stated “[They] made photographs together, they shared meals together, they experimented, explored and created together."[82] A critic noted that this exhibition leaves out mention of her suicide. Instead of highlighting that event, which can dominate the discussion around her art output, this exhibition focuses on her early work, including playful and even ordinary moments from her life.</li>
