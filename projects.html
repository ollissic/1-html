    <p>The first solo museum exhibition of Woodman's work was presented at the Wellesley College Museum, Massachusetts and Hunter College Art Gallery, New York in 1986. This seminal exhibition began a robust museum interest in Woodman's work that continues in the present. Other notable solo museum exhibitions include the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Paris, 1998, which toured throughout Europe and a major U.S. retrospective at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2011 and the Guggenheim Museum, New York in 2012.  Francesca Woodman: On Being an Angel was organized by and presented at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm in 2015 and travelled to several European cities. Woodman has been included in numerous group exhibitions throughout the United States, Europe, and Latin America.</p>
