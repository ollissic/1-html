    <p>Woodman's work focuses on the human body in space, in particular the female figure and self-portraiture.

        <b>Francesca Woodman</b> (<i>1958 - 1981</i>), a prodigious talent, made her first mature photograph at the age of thirteen and created a body of work that has been critically acclaimed in the years since her death. Born into a family of artists in Boulder, Colorado, she also spent much of her childhood in Italy.</p>

    <p>Much of Woodman's work was produced as a student at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, where she studied from 1975-1978. During this time she had solo exhibitions at Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Massachusetts in 1976 and her thesis exhibition at Woods-Gerry Gallery, RISD, in 1978. From 1977-78, Woodman lived in Rome as part of the RISD Rome Honors Program, presenting a solo exhibition at Libreria Maldoror in 1978. She moved to New York in 1979. She was a fellow at the prestigious MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire during the summer of 1980. During her lifetime, Woodman was included in group exhibitions at Galleria Ugo Ferrante, Rome, 1978; Daniel Wolf, Inc, New York, 1980; and the Alternative Museum, New York, 1980, where she presented the Temple Project, the largest and most complex from her diazotype series now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Her artist's book, Some Disordered Interior Geometries, was published by Synapse Press in 1981.</p>
